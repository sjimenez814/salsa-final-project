        title: 'Biltmore Ballroom',
        location: '2230 Church Ave, Brooklyn, NY',
        description: `Here is an image of a poster from the 90’s regarding a reggae performance at Biltmore Ballroom in Brooklyn, NY. It was located at 2230 Church Ave. Within the poster, you can see the various names of the performing artists, all of whom have ties to Jamaica. There are a lot of interesting things to analyze when looking at this poster. First off, it is important to notice how it says that the doors open at 10:30 P.M. According to Prof. Washburne, the majority of people probably wouldn’t show up until much later in the night despite being invited at this time, so this poster likely matches his description. In the bottom left, it is noted how the first single women who attend the event will get in for free. Considering the band is all male, and only men are portrayed on the poster, it probably is no coincidence that women are encouraged to attend for their sexual appeal to men. Furthermore, since this event was in the 90’s, the perception of women was definitely much different than it was today. In class, we learned about how reggae/reggaeton artists such as Daddy Yankee have consistently produced songs with lyrics that are misogynistic towards women, yet claim that this language is a part of their culture and childhood. `,

        description: `The Negril Nightclub was a legendary venue located in the basement of 181 2nd Avenue in the East Village, NYC. With a capacity of 200 people, this small but influential club was a hotspot for diverse crowds, with people from different backgrounds, religions, and ethnicities coming together to party.

        Known for its exceptional advertising, the Negril Nightclub became a vital part of New York's nightlife scene. It helped popularize hip hop music, with events like "hip-hop nights" attracting new faces and fostering a unique cultural exchange.

        The club’s impact on the rise of hip hop music in the U.S. is significant, as it provided a space where reggae-influenced hip hop artists could connect with the public and spread the genre across the country.`,

The key element of this dancehall includes integration of older and newer reggae songs, as the DJ commonly plays artists all the way from Bob Marley to Chronixx. Following common themes of other reggae venues, this place has become known as a dance hall throughout the years, and offers entertainment up to this day. Based on images from the venue’s website, cultural pride is very evident at this venue as its lighting represents the Jamaican flag. The venue also appears to be underground, similar to many of the venues that have been mentioned by other artists who have worked and performed at reggae venues. On another note, the DJ’s are said to have great abilities and influence over this venue, and understandably so considering their inclusion of older and newer hits.`,

        description: `This image displays another advertisement for a different reggae lounge located in New York City, quite literally titled “ReggaeLounge.”Thisplacewas located 285 West Broadway. The poster depicts figures walking on the beach with a horse or donkey included. This subtly hints that they are in a rural Jamaican setting, which has been a very common theme throughout all of the reggae music videos that we have watched in class. Reggae musicians love to connect to their roots and embrace, in many cases, the rural identity that started it all. This imagery could also emphasize themes of labor, rural struggles, and the dignity of ordinary people that exist within the country. In our class, we also learned that genres such as Mento have helped influence reggae. Mento was mostly popular amongst rural and poorer communities back in Jamaica, and farm life was much more common for them. These themes have remained relevant in modern reggae songs and have been passed down through generations as individuals from this culture cherish their homeland, while also recognizing their home in New York City. In the Despacito music video, for example, rural homelands and communities are emphasized, and the video is a modern version of these values. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that there is a ship leaving the coast on this poster. This is likely representative of the connection that Jamaicans, and other Caribbeans in general, have between their homeland and other places (such as New York City.) In general, this poster is a great example of the constant themes of identity and origin within the reggae genre, and a great advertisement by this 80’s lounge to draw in more customers.

        location: '237 W 42nd St, Manhattan, NY',
        description: `This was a performance venue located at 237 W 42nd St, New York. This place was very famous for reggae performances, such as the detailed one by Tarrus Riley on August 25, 2009, which we will examine in depth here. Riley emphasized unity throughout his music, which has become one of the most common themes amongst all other reggae artists. He incorporated American and European sounds into Caribbean rhythms. Riley followed the Lover’s Rock, a subgenre of reggae music that focuses more on romantic appeal and expression, and proceeded into covers of artists such as Michael Jackson. The night consisted of many songs from the Lover’s Rock genre, along with covers of more American or European influenced pop music with reggae twists. Instruments very common to reggae were used, such as bass, drums, keys, and more. Horns were also used to add layers to the music. Through the mixture of Lover’s Rock and songs about peace and unity, Riley and his band members managed to convey the same prominent theme seen throughout much of New York City reggae: unity. The band members did not focus on appealing solely to Jamaican residents, despite making many nods to their celebrities and culture (such as a shoutout to Usain Bolt, who had won an Olympic event around this time.) The members focused on songs with inclusionary lyrics, aiming to introduce Jamaican idealisms to the audience members while maintaining a balance that made the music seem very open-minded and unifying. Another key factor of performances like these is the physical movement by performers. Not only did the band members sing songs that were typically performed in dance halls (therefore encouraging audience dancing and participation,) but the band members would unite amongst each other to perform songs in harmony. At the end of the 2009 performance, Riley united with the backup singers to show an overall theme of unity amongst the artists to conclude the night. Even though nods to Jamaican identity were made, including the performance of songs like Riley’s “Africa Awaits” which emphasized Jamaican origins, the performers ended on a note that left everyone feeling seen by the genre.

        description: `Bob Marley has performed in large, open spaces such as Central Park. Performances like these are reflective of the street and community cultures that much of Caribbean music has prioritized throughout its history. Bob Marley specifically performed at the 1975 Schaefer Music Festival in Central Park. The prices for this event were very inexpensive, going as low as one dollar. This only contributed to the widespread appeal for everyone to attend. Lee Jaffe, the only white member of the Wailers, played the harmonica in this performance, and it was one of his only live experiences with the rest of the band.  The mayor of New York City actually gave Marley a “key to the city,” a gift that symbolizes positive influence on the New York citizens. Within the older New York Times article from 1975, the reviewer explains how the band was accompanied by two female singers, which likely would have been uncommon at the time. Marley’s voice is actually described as not so emotionally powerful, and the journalist expresses their doubts about the potential success of the performance. They explain how the particular syncopation of reggae music, its duple meter, and its emphasis on Jamaican culture could have been questionable aspects when considering the wide appeal to diverse audiences. Ironically, this did not turn out to be the case. The author also mentioned how reggae music typically did covers during the time, which was what American audience members were used to. Our class learned about the mento genre, started by the Jolly Boys, which provided covers of popular songs through a reggae-lens. These covers have remained popular throughout the years, as evident by pieces such as “Rehab” by the Jolly Boys (which we learned about in class,) yet Bob Marley managed to introduce American audience members to a completely new type of reggae music that was unique to him.

        location: 'New York, NY',
        description: `Bob Marley and the Wailers also performed at significant venues, such as Madison Square Garden. As seen by clips from the newspaper article Billboard magazine regarding the performance, everything was very new to reggae fans and audience members at the time. Within the newspaper clipping, it is most interesting to note that Marley’s audience were beginning to grow much more diverse by this point in time. As the author of the article points out, it could have been due to Marley’s themes of overall peace rather than direct political messaging. Additionally, the traditional reggae practices of smooth and simple beats were forgotten in this performance, as Marley and his band members became innovators of the genre that day. The bass played a huge role in this innovation, as bass instruments in the band were played much more intensely and quickly than many past performances. In terms of overall performance, the band utilized more powerful and moving rhythms in comparison to past reggae songs, drawing attention from a much larger audience. This piece of history shows how much of an innovator Bob Marley was, as he took the former boundaries of reggae music and popularized them by making them unique and broadly-appealing. One of the common themes that we can see by analyzing these historical performances in well-known venues and/or parks is that, when artists perform in such renowned places, their songs have typically been very innovative, inclusive, and bold. Marley is a perfect example of someone who has taken advantage of opportunities to perform at well-known events at Madison Square Garden and the Schaefer Festival by introducing unique takes on reggae that have compelled it forward. What better place to spread the new themes and practices of reggae than the most populated areas in New York City? It seems to not be a coincidence. These city-center venues were used as a catalyst for change, as evident by clippings of history regarding the elements that people like Marley introduced to the world while performing there. `,

Operating from multiple Bronx locations—initially a damp basement on 211th Street and later moving to a larger space at 4731 White Plains Road—Wackies Reggae Studio became a vital hub for New York's reggae scene. Founded by Lloyd “Bullwackie” Barnes, who was born in Kingston’s Trench Town (known as the birthplace of reggae), Wackies drew in artists such as Lee “Scrach” Perry [Dub], Heptone Leroy Sibbles of The Heptones (one of the most influential trios in the 1960s and 1970s), and Horace Andy. Wackies not only helped preserve some of the more traditional reggae artists but also produced music that led to dub and dancehall emergence. Releases like Keith Hudson’s “Playing it Cool & Playing it Right: in 1981 [Dub] and Sugat Minott’s “Dance Hall showcase vol II” pushed reggae into subgenres that moved beyond roots reggae.  `,

This was also the first store to import reggae records from Jamaica into the U.S. In recent years, the former store created a scholarship for minority high school students interested in pursuing musical studies at a higher level, which goes to show the impact that the store seeks to have by remaining influential within the local communities.

The most helpful factor in this store’s rise to popularity was the fact that it resold very distinct and rare reggae records. This music store also draws connections to Wackie’s, the original record store that was established in the Bronx. Jammyland’s efforts are highly influential even to the Bronx reggae scene, where it has revitalized the music of Lloyd Barnes, the man who established Wackie’s. The reissue of Horace Andy’s Dance Hall Style, a classic Wackie’s recording, had become a customer favorite, reflecting how the store connects global reggae traditions with New York's unique contributions. Now, Jammyland is a cultural hub that embodies the essence of reggae and dub as art forms centered on innovation. The store pays homage to producers like King Tubby and Lee Perry, who transformed reggae into a musical art that emphasizes rhythmic expression. This store has also served as a physical and symbolic gathering place for reggae legends and even average enthusiasts, fostering a sense of community. Icons like Studio One founder Coxsone Dodd, dub pioneer Jah Shaka, and artists Sister Carol and Junior Reid have all visited the store or hung out within its walls. The store overall provided a sense of uniqueness to many reggae lovers and allowed the genre to become more retro.

        location: '419 Tompkins Ave, Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn',
        description: `The Lover’s Rock reggae bar in Bedstuy, Brooklyn, represents the 80’s subgenre very well. Based on the personal account of this author, who visited the bar when it first opened, the bar helped establish past reggae themes within the bustling musical scene in Bedstuy. The name of the bar itself, Lover’s Rock, is a nod to the subgenre of reggae that focused on romantic expression and was popular during the 1980’s. This bar fits well into the popularized DJ scene within the neighborhood, yet it brings back the older style of Lover’s Rock. One of the owners of the bar, Shane Feirstein, explained in an interview that Lover’s Rock was more than a subgenre—it was a state of mind that was open to all interpretations. Once again, based on this input, we can see how the reggae music industry in New York City has emphasized inclusion above almost every other aspect. By explaining that Lover’s Rock was not only a subgenre of reggae music but a mindset that all people can personally interpet and incorporate into their lives, Feirstein is seemingly encouraging more and more people to embrace reggae music and let it fill the gaps within their lives. This idealism has likely led to the widespread appeal of the genre within places like New York City. Bars like this have also shaped the Bedstuy neighborhood (and other neighborhoods with large Caribbean populations) by giving them an inclusionary vibe that attracts people from all walks of the metropolitan area. Then, these venues all tend to incorporate elements of Jamaican culture while embracing open-mindedness and inclusion; for instance, at this bar, it is mentioned how the restaurant theme is tropical, with images of palm trees and colors that were similar to those used widely in the Caribbean during recent decades. The alcohol menu, according to Feirstein, also seemed to be mostly from the Caribbean islands, which could provide a sense of comfort to the people native to those countries. It is very likely that venues like these serve as a haven for Jamaican identity and cultural expression, while embracing open-mindedness in order to spread through the ranks of influence throughout the city. After all, this reggae bar fit right in with the neighborhood it was built in and developed a distinct identity by representing an older subgenre of reggae (a genre that already encourages inclusion.)

        In places like Flatbush, Brooklyn, there is a huge emphasis on reggae culture - more so than any other area within the U.S. This neighborhood, based on personal accounts from research dissertations, represents mass amounts of cultural pride for Jamaica (the ethnicity that makes up most of its population.) Melodies that are key to the reggae genre can be heard in the streets, as percussive reggae beats like the “boom-chick-boom-chick” are commonly played within cars, restaurants, and even by street vendors. The cultural influence of Jamaica can be more than auditory, though - the foods, the smells, the colors, the flags, and more are all representative of the country’s proud cultural hub within Flatbush.
